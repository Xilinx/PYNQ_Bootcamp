The fastest option would be if we could build custom hardware -- a specialized electronic circuit -- that performs exactly the computations we need.

FPGAs consist of a large number of gates that we can use to route electricity (which we use to encode data) different ways. This is different from \"normal\" processor programming: Regular processors read a stream of instructions (our program) and execute those instructions. On FPGAs, we configure a circuit once ahead of time, and can then use it to perform the function it was designed to do multiple times very quickly. The KRIA SoM comes with an FPGA. \n",
