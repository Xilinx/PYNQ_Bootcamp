    " ## Controlling an External LED\n",
    "First we are going to look at how to control an external LED. Unlike the internal LEDS, external LEDS require a few components to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these components is the LED itself. The LED has two \"legs\" connected by the colored part. Each leg is a different connection while the colored part is the light. The longer leg is the anode (positive) and the shorter leg is the cathode (negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a diagram of an LED.\n",
    "<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/%2B-_of_LED_2.svg/800px-%2B-_of_LED_2.svg.png width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is a resistor. A resistor is a component that resists the flow of current. To put it simply, the resistor limits the amount of power that can pass through the LED, keeping it from burning up. Unlike an LED, a resistor isn't sided, that is, it doesn't matter which side you connected where.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a picture of a few resistors.\n",
    "<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Electronic-Axial-Lead-Resistors-Array.jpg/1280px-Electronic-Axial-Lead-Resistors-Array.jpg width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The third component is a breadboard. Breadboards are not strictly necessary, but they can help make connecting all the wires a lot easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a picture of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Electronics-White-Breadboard.jpg/1920px-Electronics-White-Breadboard.jpg width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The final component is jumper wires! Jumper wires allow us to connect components on a breadboard to each other and to things like the PYNQ board. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a picture. \n",
