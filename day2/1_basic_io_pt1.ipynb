    "Yesterday you played around with the on-board LEDs, buttons, and switches. Now we are going to learn about how to control external peripherals. External peripherals are similar to internal peripherals in behavior. The power of using external peripherals is their ability to be added or removed easily."

    " ## Controlling an External LED\n",
    "First we are going to look at how to control an external LED. Unlike the internal LEDS, external LEDS require a few components to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these components is the LED itself. The LED has two \"legs\" connected by the colored part. Each leg is a different connection while the colored part is the light. The longer leg is the anode (positive) and the shorter leg is the cathode (negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a diagram of an LED.\n",
    "<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/%2B-_of_LED_2.svg/800px-%2B-_of_LED_2.svg.png width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is a resistor. A resistor is a component that resists the flow of current. To put it simply, the resistor limits the amount of power that can pass through the LED, keeping it from burning up. Unlike an LED, a resistor isn't sided, that is, it doesn't matter which side you connected where.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a picture of a few resistors.\n",
    "<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Electronic-Axial-Lead-Resistors-Array.jpg/1280px-Electronic-Axial-Lead-Resistors-Array.jpg width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The third component is a breadboard. Breadboards are not strictly necessary, but they can help make connecting all the wires a lot easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a picture of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Electronics-White-Breadboard.jpg/1920px-Electronics-White-Breadboard.jpg width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The final component is jumper wires! Jumper wires allow us to connect components on a breadboard to each other and to things like the PYNQ board. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a picture. \n",

    "- 1 breadboard\n",
    "\n",
    "A few connections are required for us to use the LED. We will start with connecting everything on the breadboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will connect all the components to your breadboard. Setup your breadboard like the one in the next photo. Note that your wires may not be the same color as in the picture. The kinked leg of the LED corresponds to the annode (the longer led).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=data/led_connection_picture.jpg>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will connect the breadboard. The breadboard needs two connections to the PYNQ board to function, power and ground. The top cable (yellow in the picture) should be connected to pin `AR0` on the PYNQ board. The bottom cable, (gray in the picture) should be connected to pin `GND` on the PYNQ board.\n",
