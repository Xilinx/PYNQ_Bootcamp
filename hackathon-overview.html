            <p class="text">
              Hackathons are events where teams come together to collaboratively work on a creative and new project. Participants brainstorm ideas, come up with possible solutions to their problem, and design a working prototype by the end of the hackathon. Hackathons often have a specific theme, providing a focused direction for the projects. </p>

            <p class="text">The last two days of the bootcamp will have students working together in teams to design and build a project using what they learned from the bootcamp in a hackathon-style format. This year’s theme is <strong>Deploying AI in the Real World with AMD Technologies</strong>, reflecting the bootcamp’s focus on AI and Machine Learning.</p>

              The hackathon showcase will take place on the last day of the bootcamp and will be at the Summit
              Retreat at AMD's office. We invite parents to come and see what projects the students created during the hackathon.
              Some notes about the showcase:
              <ul>
                <li> Exhibition style: Each team will have a table in the summit retreat where they will set up their project and presentation. 
                  Parents and judges will be able to walk around and look at and ask questions about each project.</li>
                <li> Teams will have 7 minutes to present their project to the judges during their assigned time slot.</li>
                <li> Students, feel free to walk around and look at other projects when you are not presenting to the judges. Just make sure to always have at least three people at the station.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
